* Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter

This is an implementation of the mekf for use in [[http://satlab.aau.dk/][AAU SATLAB's]] 6th cube sat.
The implementation is written in rust and uses geometric algebra as a backend for doing rotaions.
For now, it is running on a stm32f446 microcontroller.

* Use
To run this code ether clone this repo and with a locally installed version of rust.

** Recommend use
Run with the nix package manager using [[https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes][flakes]] and [[https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv][direnv]].

*** Linux
Use the [[https://nixos.org/download/][guide]] on nixos.org.
*** Windows
Use [[https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install][WSL2]] and what ever distro. When use the [[https://nixos.org/download/][guide]] on nixos.org.

* TODO
Add types using GaMultivector as backend.
- Vectors
- Bivectors
- Rotors

Add different rotation tests

Add the mekf
